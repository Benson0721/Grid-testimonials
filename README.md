## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS grid layout
- Flexbox
- Scss
- Postcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I’ve been working on another grid challenge. To be honest, I don’t think the grid layout itself is too difficult. However, I’ve realized that I have some misunderstandings about basic CSS concepts while using grid. This practice requires applying identical color designs to each section, and organizing the CSS has been a challenge for me. I think that’s why I’ve spent almost four hours on it!

### Continued development

I want to get more familiar with react and grid layout, so I will keep practise that in the futrue practise!
And I want to use tailwind css framework next time!
